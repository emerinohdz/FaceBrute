FaceBrute 
Facebook brute force script 

This script tries to guess passwords for a given facebook
account using a list of passwords (dictionary).
Since facebook temporaly blocks access to accounts that 
continously fail to login, this script is coded so
that it waits a specified amount of time when this happens
until the lock on the account is released.
